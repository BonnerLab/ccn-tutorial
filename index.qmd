title: "A High-Dimensional View of Neuroscience"
subtitle: "Tutorial session at [Cognitive Computational Neuroscience 2023](https://2023.ccneuro.org/kt3.php)"
abstract: |
    Advances in technology enable us to record neural responses to many thousands of stimuli from a huge number of channels (e.g. fMRI in humans, two-photon imaging in mice, neuropixel probes in monkeys). Given the unprecedented scale of these data -- collected with incredible effort at enormous expense -- what computational tools can we use to study neural representations in high dimensions? What theoretical insights can we gain about the nature of neural representations from large-scale datasets?
